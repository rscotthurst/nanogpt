    "We can think of attention as a communication mechanism. Think of it as a group of nodes in a directed graph like the one above, with edges pointing between nodes. Every node has a vector of information and aggregates information via a weighted sum from all the nodes that point to it. Our graph doesn't quite look like the above, because we have 8 nodes (block size is 8). The first node is only pointed to by itself, second is pointed to by itself and the first, all the way up to the eighth node that is pointed to by all previous nodes and itself. But in principle attention can be applied to any directed graph. It's just a communication mechanism between nodes."

This is why we needed to encode them positionally and give them information anchored to a specific position so they know where they are. This is different than a convolutional neural network, which has this concept out of the box. Here we had to specifically add it to the vectors it by masking (in our case we used `tril`)."

Cross-attention is used when there is a separate source of nodes that we're pulling information from into our nodes."
